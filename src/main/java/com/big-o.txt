"Asymptotic" in simple terms means "what happens as something gets really, really big."

🔍 Common Asymptotic Notations:

Notation	Meaning (Simplified)        	            Example

O(1)	    Constant time – always fast	                Accessing array index
O(log n)	Logarithmic – grows slowly  	            Binary search
O(n)	    Linear – grows directly with input size	    Simple loop
O(n²)	    Quadratic – grows fast with input	        Nested loops. Not useable beyond about a million elements. An example is the number of pairs in an array.


O(log n)- often means log base 2.

When n=10, log2(10) ≈ 3.32 (algo grows  slowly —  only ~3 steps for 10 inputs needed)
